    "### Background information\n",
    "#### Why RAG?\n",
    "Two big limitations of LLM are: 1) they only know the information they are trained on; 2) they have limited input context windows. To address that, RAG is used to provide extra information and then retrieve that information when needed. \n",
    "#### What is RAG?\n",
    "RAG is Retrieval Augmented Generation. It has three stages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. \n",
    "- indexing happens ahead of time and allows you to quickly look up relevant information at query-time. \n",
    "- when a query comes, you retrieve relevant documents, combine them with your instructions and the user's query, and have the LLM generated a tailored answer in natural language. This allows you to provide information that the model hasn't seen before. "

    "We will use the Gemini API to create a vector database, retrieve answers to questions from the database and generate a final answer. You will use [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/), an open-source vector database. With Chroma, you can store embeddings alongside metadata, embed documents and queries, and search your documents. "

To operate the climate control system, use the buttons and knobs located on the center console.  Temperature: The temperature knob controls the temperature inside the car. Turn the knob clockwise to increase the temperature or counterclockwise to decrease the temperature. Airflow: The airflow knob controls the amount of airflow inside the car. Turn the knob clockwise to increase the airflow or counterclockwise to decrease the airflow. Fan speed: The fan speed knob controls the speed of the fan. Turn the knob clockwise to increase the fan speed or counterclockwise to decrease the fan speed. Mode: The mode button allows you to select the desired mode. The available modes are: Auto: The car will automatically adjust the temperature and airflow to maintain a comfortable level. Cool: The car will blow cool air into the car. Heat: The car will blow warm air into the car. Defrost: The car will blow warm air onto the windshield to defrost it.\"\n",
